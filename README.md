The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 
5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

# What is Transfer Learning ?

One of the most powerful ideas in deep learning is that sometimes we can take the knowledge of the existing neural network that has learned from one task and apply that knowledge to a separate task,for example a neural network has learnt to recognize objects like cats and then use that knowledge or use part of that knowledge to help do a better job reading x-ray scans 

With transfer learning, we basically try to exploit what has been learned in one task to improve generalization in another. We transfer the weights that a network has learned at task A to a new task B.
